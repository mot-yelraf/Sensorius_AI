# Sensorius Contract

This document is the canonical forward-only contract between current
`cPyNodus_II` firmware and current Sensorius.

The two projects move together. Old topic names and compatibility shims do not
define the contract. When other docs drift, this document wins.

## Principles

- AP bootstrap uses only `/itaot-meta` and `/itaot-init`.
- Normal runtime sync uses only MQTT.
- Nodus publishes retained full `meta` on connect/reconnect.
- After accepted runtime changes, Nodus publishes only `meta/patch`.
- Sensorius paces ordinary runtime config writes one key at a time per
  physical Nodus host and waits for `ack` plus successful `result`.

## AP Bootstrap

Routes exposed in AP mode:

- `GET /itaot-meta`
- `POST /itaot-init`

Canonical `/itaot-init` request:

```json
{
  "onboard_token": "token-123",
  "ssid": "MyWiFi",
  "password": "my-password",
  "hostname": "co2-ykdvea",
  "mqtt": {
    "broker_host": "samhain.local",
    "broker_port": 1883
  }
}
```

Canonical success response:

```json
{
  "accepted": true,
  "rebooting": true
}
```

Bootstrap rules:

- Validate required fields and types.
- Persist only supported Network, MQTT, and Profile settings.
- Keep onboarding protocol state out of normal TOML config schema.
- If `mqtt.active_profile` is omitted and `mqtt.broker_host` is present,
  infer `ACTIVE_PROFILE = "sensorius"`.

## MQTT Topics

## Onboarding MQTT Flow

1. Nodus joins Wi-Fi and MQTT.
2. Nodus publishes `nodus/<device_id>/onboard/hello`.
3. Sensorius validates the token and sends one full onboarding
   `nodus/<device_id>/config/set` envelope.
4. Nodus publishes `config/ack`.
5. Nodus publishes `config/result`.
6. Nodus publishes retained `nodus/<device_id>/meta`.

Canonical `onboard/hello` payload:

```json
{
  "onboard_token": "token-123",
  "device_id": "co2-ykdvea",
  "hostname": "co2-ykdvea",
  "serial": "ykdvea",
  "type": "pico2w",
  "version": "v0.26.111.15",
  "capabilities": {
    "sensor": true,
    "switch": true
  }
}
```

## Runtime Payloads

Canonical `/data` payload:

```json
{
  "schema": "nodus-sensor-data/v1",
  "sensor_id": "co2-ykdvea",
  "device": "co2",
  "location": "OfficeDesk",
  "values": {
    "CO2": 792,
    "Temperature": 22.8
  },
  "timestamp": 946709424
}
```

Canonical heartbeat payload:

```json
{
  "schema": "nodus-heartbeat/v1",
  "device_id": "co2-ykdvea",
  "status": "online",
  "timestamp": 946709424
}
```

Canonical switch state payload:

```json
{
  "schema": "nodus-switch-state/v1",
  "device_id": "switch-ykdvea",
  "channel_id": "S1-ykdvea",
  "label": "Fan",
  "state": "ON",
  "timestamp": 946709424
}
```

## Retained `meta`

Retained `nodus/<device_id>/meta` is the authoritative startup snapshot.
Sensorius uses it to rebuild the local shadow copy of Nodus state.

The payload must include:

- top-level `schema`, `device_id`, `hostname`, `serial`, `version`, `type`
- `capabilities`
- `status.heartbeat_topic`
- `network.ssid`, `network.password`, `network.hostname`
- `profile.active_profile`
- `mqtt.broker`, `mqtt.broker_ip`, `mqtt.active_broker`, `mqtt.port`,
  `mqtt.use_tls`, `mqtt.username`, `mqtt.password`, `mqtt.base_topic`
- `location_group.location`, `location_group.members`
- `sensor.sensor_id`, `sensor.location`, `sensor.data_topic`,
  `sensor.event_topic`, `sensor.availability_topic`,
  `sensor.display_metrics`, `sensor.display_styles`
- `switch.device_id`, `switch.location`
- per-channel `index`, `label`, `channel_id`, `enable_pin`, `pin`,
  `state`, `event_topic`, `state_topic`, `set_topic`, `result_topic`,
  `availability_topic`

Password fields in retained `meta` use the same `obf1:` obfuscation format as
persisted TOML password fields. They are not plaintext.

## Retained Command Cleanup

`/set` topics are command topics, not state topics. Sensorius should publish
commands non-retained unless a specific command flow requires retained delivery.

When Sensorius intentionally publishes any `/set` command retained, Sensorius
owns removing that retained command after successful handling by publishing an
empty retained payload to the same topic. Nodus ignores empty `/set` payloads.

Sensorius retained-command sequence:

1. Publish the command to the relevant `/set` topic with `retain = true`.
2. Wait for the correlated `ack`.
3. Wait for the correlated successful `result`.
4. Consume the correlated retained state, event, or `meta/patch` update as
   applicable.
5. Publish an empty retained payload to the same `/set` topic.

Current implementation:

- Nodus ignores empty payloads on switch `nodus/<channel_id>/config/set`.
- Nodus ignores empty payloads on ordinary device
  `nodus/<device_id>/config/set`.
- Nodus ignores empty payloads on `nodus/<device_id>/calibration/set`.
- Nodus does not publish empty retained cleanup payloads to `/set` topics.

## Ordinary `config/set`

Canonical topic:

- `nodus/<device_id>/config/set`

Canonical Sensorius envelope:

```json
{
  "message_id": "cfg-123",
  "payload": {
    "updates": [
      {
        "section": "Sensor",
        "key": "LOCATION",
        "value": "OfficeDesk",
        "name": "sensor_i2c.toml"
      }
    ]
  },
  "restart": false
}
```

Canonical replies:

```json
{"message_id":"cfg-123","accepted":true,"duplicate":false}
{"message_id":"cfg-123","applied":true,"updated":1,"duplicate":false,"error":""}
```

Implemented behavior:

- Nodus publishes `config/ack` after a valid envelope is accepted for
  handling.
- Duplicate `message_id` values produce `config/ack` with
  `duplicate = true` and `config/result` with `applied = true`,
  `updated = 0`, and `duplicate = true`.
- Accepted non-duplicate writes publish `config/result` and a non-retained
  `meta/patch` with `source = "config_set"`.
- Failed validation or rejected writes publish `config/result` with
  `applied = false` and an error string.
- Empty payloads on `nodus/<device_id>/config/set` are ignored. This allows
  Sensorius retained command cleanup publishes to be received safely after
  reconnect.
- Nodus does not clear `nodus/<device_id>/config/set`; Sensorius owns retained
  command cleanup for commands it publishes retained.

## Switch `config/set`

Canonical topic:

- `nodus/<channel_id>/config/set`

Canonical switch-control envelope:

```json
{
  "message_id": "cfg-123",
  "payload": {
    "updates": [
      {
        "section": "Switch",
        "key": "SWITCH_1_LAST_STATE",
        "value": true,
        "name": "switch.toml"
      }
    ]
  },
  "restart": false
}
```

Forward-only rule:

- JSON `config/set` is the canonical switch-control contract.
- Plain `ON` and `OFF` payloads may still be tolerated by firmware, but they
  are not the documented forward contract.

Implemented behavior:

- Empty payloads on `nodus/<channel_id>/config/set` are ignored. This allows
  Sensorius retained command cleanup publishes to be received safely after
  reconnect.
- Nodus publishes channel-scoped `config/ack` after a valid switch command is
  accepted for handling.
- Nodus applies the switch state, publishes channel-scoped `config/result`,
  publishes `event`, publishes retained `state`, and publishes a non-retained
  device `meta/patch` with `source = "switch_set"`.
- If the filesystem is writable, Nodus persists the channel
  `SWITCH_<n>_LAST_STATE` update into `switch.toml`. If persistence fails, the
  command may still be applied locally and the command result carries
  `persistence_mode = "volatile"` in serial logging.
- Nodus does not clear `nodus/<channel_id>/config/set`; Sensorius owns retained
  command cleanup for commands it publishes retained.

## `calibration/set`

Canonical topic:

- `nodus/<device_id>/calibration/set`

Canonical Sensorius envelope:

```json
{
  "message_id": "cal-123",
  "action": "apply",
  "payload": {
    "offsets": [
      {
        "key": "Calibration.Device.TEMP_OFFSET",
        "value": 1.5
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Canonical replies:

- `calibration/ack`
- `calibration/result`
- `meta/patch` with `source = "calibration_set"` for accepted writes

Implemented behavior:

- Nodus publishes `calibration/ack` after a valid calibration envelope is
  accepted for handling.
- Sensorius sends apply-style `offsets` one item per `calibration/set` command
  and waits for the correlated `ack` plus successful `result` before sending
  the next calibration value.
- Duplicate `message_id` values produce `calibration/ack` and
  `calibration/result` with `applied = true`, `updated = 0`, and no
  `meta/patch`.
- `action = "apply"`, `"set"`, or `"update"` writes accepted calibration
  values, publishes `calibration/result`, and publishes non-retained
  `meta/patch` with `source = "calibration_set"`.
- Sensorius may treat the correlated `meta/patch` as the accepted write result
  for apply-style commands if `calibration/ack` or `calibration/result` is
  missed.
- `action = "status"` republishes retained
  `nodus/<sensor_id>/event/calibration_status` and publishes a correlated
  `calibration/result`.
- Soil pH session actions publish command-scoped `calibration/result` plus the
  soil calibration event topics described in
  `docs/calibration_mqtt_contract.md`.
- Empty payloads on `nodus/<device_id>/calibration/set` are ignored. This
  allows Sensorius retained command cleanup publishes to be received safely
  after reconnect.
- Nodus does not clear `nodus/<device_id>/calibration/set`; Sensorius owns
  retained command cleanup for commands it publishes retained.

## `meta/patch`

Canonical non-retained patch payload:

```json
{
  "schema": "nodus-meta-patch/v1",
  "device_id": "co2-ykdvea",
  "timestamp": 946709500,
  "source": "config_set",
  "message_id": "cfg-123",
  "sections": ["Sensor"],
  "updates": [
    {
      "section": "Sensor",
      "key": "LOCATION",
      "value": "OfficeDesk"
    }
  ]
}
```

Patch rules:

- `meta/patch` is the incremental sync stream after startup.
- It does not replace retained startup `meta`.
- Accepted config, switch, and calibration writes should emit `meta/patch`.

## Deprecated Doc Shapes

These shapes are deprecated and should not be treated as canonical:

- `nodus/<channel_id>/set`
- switch-control docs centered on plain `ON` and `OFF`
- docs that imply ordinary runtime config writes trigger a full retained `meta`
  refresh
